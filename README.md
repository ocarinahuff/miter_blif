miter_blif
==========

A structural miter of two blif files in C, using dynamic arrays.

This file is intended for educational purposes.  It is part of an attempt to explore concepts learned in a C programming course offered by cppinstitute.org.

This is an attempt to solve a problem proposed by an instructor in Digital Testing and Verification; one of creating a structural miter between two functions, each specificed in separate blif files.  The miter is then used in verification tools such as ABC or VIS to test for SAT or UNSAT.
